# Custom Conversation Use Cases

This directory contains documentation, blueprints, examples, and helper scripts for specific use cases of the Custom Conversation integration. Each subdirectory focuses on a particular implementation scenario, providing everything you need to implement that use case in your own Home Assistant environment.

## Available Use Cases

### [Conversation Rating for ViewAssist](./conversation-rating-viewassist/README.md)
Implements automated conversation rating prompting on ViewAssist devices, allowing users to provide feedback on conversation quality directly through their ViewAssist display.

## Purpose of This Directory

The main Custom Conversation documentation covers general setup and configuration, but as the integration grows in complexity and capability, specific implementation patterns emerge that deserve their own detailed documentation. This directory serves as a repository for these implementation patterns, providing:

1. **Detailed Documentation**: Step-by-step guides for implementing specific use cases
2. **Blueprints**: Ready-to-use automation and script blueprints
3. **Example Configurations**: YAML snippets and complete examples
4. **Helper Scripts**: Additional code to extend functionality for specific scenarios

Note that the content in this directory supplements the main documentation but focuses on specific implementation patterns rather than general configuration. Always refer to the main README for basic setup and configuration options.

## Contributing

If you've developed an interesting use case for Custom Conversation that you'd like to share, please consider contributing it to this directory. Follow the existing structure and include:

- A README.md with clear documentation
- Any necessary blueprints, scripts, or configuration examples
- Screenshots or diagrams if they help explain the implementation
