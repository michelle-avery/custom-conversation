# Helpful Blueprints
This directory contains Home Assistant blueprints that users of Custom Conversation have found useful. They may or 
may not be compatible with other Home Assistant uses.

## Google Search
This blueprint creates a script that, if exposed to your LLM, will allow you to search Google for a given query.
It requires that you have a conversation agent using the Google Generative AI Integration with Web search enabled, but
that does not need to be your primary agent.
